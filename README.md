New icon for the KOReader app on PocketBook devices that fits the style of the current PocketBook OS.

**Only tested on the following devices (Firmware 6.8.xxxx and 6.10.xxxx):**
- Era Color (icons should fit the normal Era too)
- Verse Pro (icons should fit the Verse Pro Color too)

If you have a different PocketBook device and none of the icons above fit perfectly contact me.

Instructions for how to change the app icon (and the name of the app) can be found here: https://github.com/jjrrw174/PocketBook-Desktop-and-App-Customizations/tree/main
